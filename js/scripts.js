//This is my javascript. I want to see if it's working

// console.log("My javascript is working.")


//In Javascript, there are five data types

//1) A string, which is a sequence of characters

var myString = "Hello world!";
//console.log(myString);

//2) A number

var myNumber = 24;
//console.log(myNumber);
//console.log(myNumber+70);
//console.log(myNumber.toString()+6);

//3) An Arra, which is a fancy word for a list

var myArray = ["a","b","c","d"];
// console.log(myArray);
// console.log(myArray[3]);
// console.log(myArray.length);
myArray.push("Harry");
// console.log(myArray);
myArray.push(myNumber);
// console.log(myArray);

//4) An object, which is a set of key value pairs

var myObject={
  name: "Sanshey",
  age: 24,
  classmates: myArray
}

//5) A boolean, which is true or false
var myBool = true;
var myOtherbool = false;
